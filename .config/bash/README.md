# bashrc configurations

Host-specifics (including in `~vern`), maybe bash-specific functions.
Global configs are at [`~/.bashrc`](../../.bashrc),
[`~/.bash_login`](../../.bash_login) and [POSIX-compliant `~/.profile`](../../.profile).

## Directories and files

* `completions`
* `hosts`
* `shell-prompts`
* `tools`
* `aliases`
